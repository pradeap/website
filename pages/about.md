A self learnt Data Engineer trying to built a enterprise level data architecture. 

Why Data Mechanic?

Transitioning from the mechanical domain to the data domain may be challenging, yet it proves rewarding in terms of exploration. Combining data and mechanical expertise opens up new avenues for innovation

Hence

<span class="catchy-text">Data Mechanic</span>

<!-- Self learning Data Engineering is hard when you want to move from different domain, especially from non - computer science background. As a person from Mechanical Engineering background I went through the process of learning(Still learning) the jargons of Data Engineering. 


I aim to debunk all the techical terms in an understandable way and make the transition process smooth. There are lot of terminologies and tools involved in Data Engineering, once the basics are well understood, it can be used in different applications.


The world of Data Engineering involves numerous technologies and tools, such as API, SQL, Clusters, Servers, SSH, Cloud, Git, etc. I intend to break down these terminologies and tools in a way that's easily comprehensible, drawing parallels with my own experience.


Building a enterprise level data architecture is challenging, My goal is to make Data Engineering accessible for individuals from diverse backgrounds to be able to achieve that.
